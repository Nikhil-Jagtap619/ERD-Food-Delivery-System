Online Food Ordering System ER Diagram
This document outlines the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for an Online Food Ordering System, a web and mobile-based e-commerce platform designed for organizations to showcase menus and process customer orders. The ERD serves as the foundational design for the system's database.

ERD Components Explained:
Entities (Rectangles): Represent tables in the database.

Attributes (Ovals): Represent columns or fields within tables. Underlined attributes denote primary keys.

Relationships (Diamonds): Illustrate connections between entities (e.g., primary key to foreign key links).

Key Steps in ERD Creation:
Identify Entities: Determine all core components that will store data.

Identify Relationships: Define how these entities interact with each other (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many).

Add Attributes: Specify the details and characteristics for each entity.

Entities in the Online Food Ordering System ERD:
The system's design incorporates nine primary entities:

User: Manages user accounts and access.

Site Information: Stores general website details.

Payment: Handles transaction data.

Order: Records customer orders.

Order Details: Contains specifics of items within an order.

Customer: Stores customer profiles.

Rating: Manages customer feedback and ratings.

Menu: Contains information about food items.

Menu Type: Categorizes menu items.

Relationships Overview:
The ERD defines various relationships, including:

One-to-one between User and Site Information.

One-to-many between User and Order.

One-to-many between Customer and Order.

And many other relationships linking the entities to ensure data integrity and flow.

Attributes:
Each entity is detailed with specific attributes, including primary keys (underlined) and foreign keys (linking to other tables).

This ERD is the blueprint for the database, and the next phase involves converting this design into an actual functional database.
